      " Sure! Here are a few suggestions from our extensive list of popular dishes:\n",
      "- Chicken Tikka Masala - A classic dish made with tender pieces of marinated chicken cooked in a creamy tomato-based sauce, usually served over steamed rice.\n",
      "- Butter Chicken - A creamy and flavorful curry made with ground beef or lamb, tomatoes, onions, and spices, served with basmati rice.\n",
      "- Naan Bread - Soft, fluffy bread that's traditionally cooked on a hot griddle, making it the perfect accompaniment to any Indian meal.\n",
      "- Vegetable Biryani - A fragrant and flavorful dish made with rice, vegetables, and a blend of spices, topped with fried onions and dried fruits for added sweetness.\n",
      "- Masala Dosa - A popular South Indian pancake made from fermented rice and lentil batter, cooked in a spicy tomato-based batter and served with coconut chutney or sambar.\n",
      "I hope this helps!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In our conversation above about the 'Spice Up Your Palate' menu item, five dishes were suggested: Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, Naan Bread, Vegetable Biryani, and Masala Dosa. \n",
      "\n",
      "Assume that we have a database of customer reviews for these dishes, each with a rating between 1 (least favorite) to 5 (most favorite). Also consider the following statements:\n",
      "1. The overall average rating for all the dishes is 3.2.\n",
      "2. Chicken Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken both scored lower than Naan Bread in terms of customer preference.\n",
      "3. Vegetable Biryani has a higher average rating than Masala Dosa, which has a higher rating than Butter Chicken.\n",
      "4. None of the dishes have the same rating. \n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the possible minimum and maximum average ratings for each dish?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By using deductive logic, we can conclude that Naan Bread cannot be rated 1 or 2 as it would bring down the overall average below 3.2 (Statement 2). Similarly, Chicken Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken cannot have a rating of 5 because if they did, the other ratings would need to drop to maintain an average score of 3.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applying inductive logic, we can infer that Vegetable Biryani must be rated between 4-5 as it has a higher average than other dishes (Statement 3). However, since no two dishes have the same rating, the highest possible rating for Vegetable Biryani cannot exceed 5 and the lowest possible rating must be 4. The average rating for Vegetable Biryani is then calculated to be (4+5+1+2+3)/5 = 2.8.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, we can infer that Masala Dosa has a higher average rating than Vegetable Biryani, but cannot exceed 5 because of the same reasoning in step 1 and also the rule about no two dishes having equal ratings. The minimum possible score is 4 (for a score of 3.2 for all the dishes combined), and it's calculated to be (4+3+1+2+5)/5 = 2.6.\n",
      "\n",
      "To find the maximum average rating for each dish, we need to take into account the current ratings. Chicken Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken can't have a rating of 5 because that would mean their cumulative score would equal or exceed the total possible score (20), which means other dishes wouldn't get an opportunity to make higher scores. Hence, for these two dishes, we can give them 4, 3, 2, 1 in some order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining dishes must have a score of 5 as it's the highest possible score and all the others will need to be less than that in order for the total average (2.6) to equal or exceed 3.2. Therefore, by process of elimination, Vegetable Biryani and Masala Dosa should both have a rating of 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: \n",
      "The minimum possible ratings per dish are as follows:\n",
      "- Chicken Tikka Masala: 2 \n",
      "- Butter Chicken: 1 \n",
      "- Naan Bread: 3 \n",
      "- Vegetable Biryani: 4 \n",
      "- Masala Dosa: 5 \n",
      "The maximum possible rating for the dishes, assuming all are at their highest score (5), would be 20. This also meets the condition that no two dishes have the same rating and results in an overall average of 3.2. \n",

Samosa Tikka - Soft samosas stuffed with spiced chicken or paneer and served with yogurt and chutney.\\n\\nThese are just a few ideas for a \"Indian Fusion\" restaurant, but there are countless other options you could explore!\\n\\n\\nIn the world of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems development team, imagine this: You\\'ve been tasked to build an AI-based menu recommendation system for your company\\'s new \"Indian Fusion\" restaurant. Your task is to design a system that provides a personalized dining experience by suggesting 5 recommended dishes based on user preferences and their previous eating history. \\n\\nThe AI model uses the following rules to make its recommendations:\\n\\n1. If a customer prefers spicy food, it will recommend either the Spicy Chicken Tandoori Wrap or the Lamb Tikka Masala.\\n2. For customers who have shown a liking for Asian flavors in the past, it will suggest the Vegetable Biryani.\\n3. For those with a fondness for Mediterranean flavors, it will recommend the Chickpea Salad.\\n4. If the customer has ever ordered something sweet before, the system will not recommend any dessert dishes.\\n5. In order to keep things interesting, the AI will suggest at least one dish that hasn\\'t been recommended in the past by other users with similar preferences. \\n6. The total number of dishes recommended should be exactly 5. \\n\\nGiven these rules and the following information:\\n- User A prefers spicy food.\\n- User B has previously ordered a Lamb Tikka Masala.\\n- User C likes Asian flavors, but does not have a sweet tooth.\\n- User D loves dessert, but also enjoys trying new dishes.\\n- User E has previously avoided spicy food and the Spicy Chicken Tandoori Wrap. \\n\\nQuestion: What could be the AI-based menu recommendation system\\'s response for each user?\\n\\n\\nFor User A, who prefers spicy food, based on Rule 1, the AI system will suggest either the Spicy Chicken Tandoori Wrap or the Lamb Tikka Masala.\\n\\nUser B has a preference for Lamb Tikka Masala and has previously ordered it. Based on this information and the rules, the AI system will recommend that again.\\n\\nUser C likes Asian flavors but doesn\\'t have a sweet tooth. Therefore, based on Rule 2, the AI system will suggest the Vegetable Biryani.\\n\\nFor User D who loves dessert and also enjoys trying new dishes, it must be true for users with similar preferences too. So, according to Rule 4, the AI system won’t recommend any dessert dish. As such, this user could still get a unique Mediterranean-infused dish. In this case, the Chickpea Salad is an excellent choice, so the AI recommends that as well.\\n\\nFinally for User E who avoids spicy food and has previously avoided the Spicy Chicken Tandoori Wrap, it is not recommended to have spicy food again according to Rule 1. Therefore, based on rule 5, which states \"to keep things interesting\", the AI system will suggest a different dish not listed in User A\\'s, B\\'s, C\\'s or D\\'s preferences that hasn\\'t been previously tried. \\n\\nTo find this unique dish, we need to use a \"proof by exhaustion\" method and test every possible combination of dishes until we reach 5 recommendations. Considering the given options (Spicy Chicken Tandoori Wrap, Lamb Tikka Masala, Vegetable Biryani, Chickpea Salad) with the users’ preferences:\\n- If the AI system chooses a Spicy dish for User E, it will recommend the Chickpea Salad. \\n- If it chooses a non-spicy dish for User E, it will recommend the Spicy Chicken Tandoori Wrap. \\n\\nBy applying \"proof by contradiction\" and assuming that it\\'s impossible to find 5 unique combinations within these options, we can deduce that there is indeed at least one possible solution. This also confirms our use of the exhaustively searching strategy and further strengthens the validity of our proof by contradiction.\\n\\nThe result from step7 and8 leads us to conclude that:\\n- User A will get either the Spicy Chicken Tandoori Wrap or the Lamb Tikka Masala.\\n- User B will get the Lamb Tikka Masala. \\n- User C will get the Vegetable Biryani.\\n- User D will get two recommendations, one being the Chickpea Salad and another a unique Mediterranean-inspired dish that hasn\\'t been previously tried by others with similar tastes as User D.\\n- User E will get a unique Dish from any of the other users (A,B,C) who are not suggesting spicy dishes to User E (as per the fifth rule).\\n\\nAnswer: The AI-based menu recommendation system\\'s response for each user would be as follows: \\n- User A and B could choose between Spicy Chicken Tandoori Wrap or Lamb Tikka Masala.\\n- User C could go with Vegetable Biryani.\\n- User D will get a combination of Chickpea Salad and a new Mediterranean-inspired dish not mentioned by other users (A,B,C).\\n- User E would receive a unique, non-spicy dish suggested by one of the other three users (A,B,C), with no dessert recommended. \\n'}"
